#! The Problem with "In-Sample" Scores

# ? Since models' practical value come from making
# ? predictions on new data, we measure performance
# ? on data that wasn't used to build the model.
# ? The most straightforward way to do this is to exclude
# ? some data from the model-building process,
# ? and then use those to test the model's accuracy
# ? on data it hasn't seen before.
# ? This data is called validation data.
