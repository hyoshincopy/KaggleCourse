#! Hello, Python!
# ? Python was named for the British comedy troupe Monty Python,
# ? so we'll make our first Python program an homage to their skit about Spam?
# ? Just for fun, try reading over the code below and predicting what it's going to do when run.
# ? (If you have no idea, that's fine!)
# ? Then click the "output" button to see the results of our program.


spam_amount = 0
print(spam_amount)

# Ordering Spam, egg, Spam, Spam, bacon and Spam (4 more servings of Spam)
spam_amount = spam_amount + 4

if spam_amount > 0:
    print("But I don't want ANY spam!")

viking_song = "Spam " * spam_amount
print(viking_song)
