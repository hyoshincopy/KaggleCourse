Intro
This course covers the key Python skills 
youâ€™ll need so you can start using Python for data science. 
The course is ideal for someone with some previous coding experience 
who wants to add Python to their repertoire or 
level up their basic Python skills. 
(If you're a first-time coder, you may want to check out these
 "Python for Non-Programmers" learning resources.)
We'll start with a brief overview of Python syntax, 
variable assignment, and arithmetic operators. 
If you have previous Python experience, 
you can skip straight to the hands-on exercise.
